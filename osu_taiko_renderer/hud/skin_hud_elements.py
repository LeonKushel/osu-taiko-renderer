"""Reusable legacy-skin HUD elements so the Argon taiko HUD can render a skin's
digit font + scorebar HP bar per-element, falling back to Argon when the skin
doesn't ship them. Extracted from the legacy skin_hud path.

- SkinDigitFont: loads `<prefix>-0..9` (+ -comma/-dot/-percent/-x) and renders a
  number string; `.render(text, px)` matches ArgonCounter.render's interface so
  the Argon HUD can swap it in at its own draw positions. `.present` is False
  when the skin ships no digit font (then the caller uses ArgonCounter).
- SkinHealthBar: scorebar-bg + scorebar-colour[-N] top HP bar. `.present` False

# Cache each glyph's float32 alpha terms instead of recomputing them on every
# composite. ON BY DEFAULT — it is byte-identical and worth +9.7% fps (508 -> 557.7,
# sprite_build 0.758 -> 0.589, both arms repeated to three decimals). Set
# R3D_TAIKO_NO_GLYPH_TERMS=1 to fall back to the original body, which is kept
# verbatim below both as the kill switch and as the A/B reference arm.
#
# WHY THIS IS THE HUD'S BIGGEST SINGLE COST. cProfile of overlay() alone put
# _alpha_blit at 0.658 s of 2.33 s (28%), 6 calls/frame, ~53 us/call -- more than
# any other function by a factor of three. The reason is the caller below: a number
# is assembled GLYPH BY GLYPH, and the score string changes every frame, so it
# misses _ncache every frame and re-composites all ~7 digits.
#
# The old body ran ~13 numpy dispatches per call on a ~60x40 array. At that size
# dispatch is 62-83% of a numpy call (measured on this box: np.clip alone costs
# 1626 ns before touching a pixel), so the fixed overhead dominated the arithmetic.
#
# Four of those dispatches only ever touched `src`, which is CONSTANT: `parts` come
# straight out of SkinDigitFont._scaled's cache, so the same glyph array is
# composited every frame for the life of the render. Hoisting s.astype, a,
# s[...,:3]*a and (1-a) into a per-glyph cache removes them from the per-call path.
#
# This is exactly the trick hud.py::_pm_terms already uses on the Argon path;
# _alpha_blit simply never got it.
#
# BYTE-IDENTICAL, and not by luck: every hoisted operation is elementwise, and
# elementwise ops commute with cropping, so computing terms on the whole glyph and
# then slicing gives bit-for-bit what computing them on the slice gave. Verified
# across four different x offsets (including partial clips) plus the frozen oracle.

    `clean_from` is an optimisation hint, not a mode: the dst column index from

    onto zero is algebraically a plain store -- `sa + 0*inv == sa` and
    `salpha + 0*inv == salpha` -- so those columns need no read, no float
    conversion and no blend, just a copy of a per-glyph array we can cache.

    This is deliberately expressed as a GENERAL split rather than an `if overlap
    == 0` fast path. Glyph runs overlap by `int(px * overlap_frac)` px, which is 0
    for this skin's ScoreOverlap:1 at ~60px but nonzero for others; a skin-specific
    branch would optimise one skin and leave the rest. Splitting each glyph into
    "columns the previous glyph already dirtied" (blend) and "columns still
    virgin" (copy) is correct for every overlap value, and degenerates to a pure
    copy at overlap 0 without testing for it.

    Vertical extents are NOT tracked: glyphs are centred vertically, so a taller
    glyph has clean rows even inside dirty columns. Treating whole columns as
    dirty just blends where it could copy -- conservative, never wrong."""
